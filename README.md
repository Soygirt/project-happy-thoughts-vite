# Happy Thoughts

In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

### The Problem

I struggled with most things in this project since I'm having a hard time understanding react. To me, this project had been impossible to complete without help from my wonderful team mates, so I've relied heavily on other students code (shout out to Beckie!) and have basically used their code as a code-along. It has helped me a lot with my understanding of components and how to pass information between them.

I've also struggled with the media querys, it seems to be working fine in different sizes in the browser, but not on my phone. I've tried so many different things but it doesn't seem to be working the way I want it to.

If I had more time I'd fix the media queries, the colors are not as I originally wanted them to be, and I planned to use an img as the heart button. But I guess it'll be something to fix later on.
I've used chatGPT for finding bugs in snippets of code.
